### Chapter 1 - Land
---
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"_LAND!_" yells the lookout.  "_LAND AHEAD!_" he shouts down to the crew.  The captain isn't worried, after all, land is what he has been hoping for after being at sea for so long.  He turns to address the crew with a simple nod of his head in acknowledgment, the crew knows what to do and starts prepping for docking procedures.  Just then, the communications unit chimes on, "_authorization code?_" ask the operator.  The communications officer looks over at the captain with a concerned expression, "_restricted_" shrugs the captain.  He sighs heavily and keys the push-to-talk, "_This is captain_ `Sorvalice` _of the vessel_ `Vector 5`_, requesting permission to make an emergency landing at your station for immediate structural repairs._"  The channel goes silent as dock command analyses the request.  Just as the tactical officer pipes up, "_cap, what's the likelihood they see our `bogus tags` and report us to cent com..._" the radio blasts out "_acknowledged, proceed to_ **Dock Station Alpha 6** _and await further instructions._"  The captain shrugs and nods to the navigation officer "_plot us a course, we're bringing 'er in._"

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the last line is secured the crew looks at each other expecting someone to say something, but nobody does.  "_What are you waiting for?!_" barks the captain.  The newest crew member snaps to attention and quickly rushes out to _secure the cargo_, the rest of the crew prepares for inspection.  It just so happens that they stumbled upon a top secret **Federation Relay Station** and everyone knows the `Federation` is very adamant no smuggling passes through their stations, let alone a top secret installation.  "_Doc?_" says the captain, "_what is it cap_" replies the doctor, "_I need those `records deep sixed` ASAP, we can't take any risks_", "_Ay, cap_" says the doctor as he punches a few commands into his personal digital assistant, then connects it directly to an already exposed (deperming cable) which causes it to overload the power source and fry the electronics inside.  "_SHIT!_" shouts the doctor as sparks shoot from the PDA.  "_I told you not to hold it_" says the newest member as she makes her way to the captain, "_the cargo is secure, SIR!_" she says as she reaches him.  "_Heh, 'newbies' just call me captain would ya_" he says with a sigh.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _*_ He knows she only means well but they just picked her up after losing a valuable crew member on their last blown operation and nobody trusts her yet; plus, she's obviously trying way too hard to fit in.  However, she's pretty much a jack of all trades and happily accepts all of the jobs nobody else wants to do.  Just as the captain takes a sip of his coffee, which she brought to him the (external proximity sensor) chimes and everyone stiffens up.
